        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m passionate about bridging business and technology. My journey started in Commerce (Accounting) at Dedan Kimathi University, where I built a strong foundation in finance and analysis. While working at KCB Bank, I developed skills in customer relations, compliance, and problem-solving.

At the same time, I discovered my love for technology and innovation, which led me to pursue certifications in data analytics, cybersecurity, AI, and digital skills. Now, as a QA/Software Development Trainee at TEACH2GIVE, I’m growing into a role where I can merge my background in business with the technical expertise needed to deliver quality solutions.

Beyond work, I enjoy career consulting, exploring new technologies, and reading business articles—always seeking growth and ways to make an impact.
